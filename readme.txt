How to use symbols.txt
If Industry is used, sector tag must be inputted. Otherwise the program will crash
Ensure that both industry and sector tags are accurate as the program will rely on these to find the industry.
You can find necessary info here: 
Valid Sectors: https://code.google.com/p/yahoo-finance-managed/wiki/enumSectors
Industry example (these are all the industries from the technology sector): http://biz.yahoo.com/p/csv/8conameu.csv

Afterwards, input one symbol per line. The program currently does not check for invalid symbols and yahoo finance will return nothing if even one input is incorrect.

How to use sort priority:
The program prints data in the console. You will need a large console to see all the fields. The sorter has an interface. The first field in the sort priority has highest priority. “REMOVE” removes the last sort priority.
